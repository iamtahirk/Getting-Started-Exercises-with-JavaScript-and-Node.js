      You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.</li>
      <li>Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.</li>
      <li>Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.</li>
    </ul>
